<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>
For this project, I implemented a complete 3D maze game using SDL3 and OpenGL. The environment includes textured walls and floors, colored keys and doors, jumping, animated door opening, power-ups, and a moving Kodama character. The maze is fully navigable with smooth keyboard controls, collision detection, and realistic jumping using gravity and vertical velocity.
</p>

<p>
I loaded two OBJ models: a tree placed near the goal and a Kodama NPC that moves left and right in front of Door A. If the player collides with the Kodama, the game resets and prints a game-over message. I also added two rotating power-up items: the green one grants speed boost, and the orange one gives higher jump.
</p>

<p>
Each door type uses a different shape, and doors slide smoothly to the right when unlocked. I used separate textures for the walls and floors, and each key matches its door color. I also recorded two full gameplay videos (test0 and test1) which clearly demonstrate all features better than screenshots.
</p>

<p>
I attempted point lights above doors, but the fixed-pipeline lighting behaved inconsistently when the camera moved, so I could not fully finish that part. Mouse controls and bump mapping were also attempted but not completed due to time and pipeline limitations.
</p>

<b>Extra credit features I completed include:</b><br>
– Texture-mapped walls/floors<br>
– Smooth realistic jumping<br>
– Moving NPC (Kodama)<br>
– Character interaction (lose on collision)<br>
– Power-ups altering abilities<br>
– Animated sliding doors<br>
– Loading multiple OBJ models<br>
– Full gameplay videos showing all features
